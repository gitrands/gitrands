# 👾 Hey, I’m **Jeeva** — I Build Things That Don’t Crash (Usually)

> 💭 *“Backend dev with frontend opinions, AWS addiction, and a habit of over-engineering side projects.”*

Welcome to my GitHub — where microservices talk to each other more than I talk to humans, and half of my commits are “final-final-fix-2”.

## ⚡ What I Actually Do

* 🔥 **Break monoliths into microservices**
* 🐇 **Spam RabbitMQ until the queues beg for mercy**
* 🌩️ **Deploy to AWS like it’s my second home**
* 🎨 **Build UIs in React/Next.js that don’t look like 2008**
* 🧠 **Pretend I didn’t write that bug**
